# Update-533n-Cataloguing-Date-on-Alma
A bookmarklet to update the date of cataloguing in a 533 subfield $$n in the Alma Metadata Editor.

You can use this bookmarklet to avoid having to either change a template every day you use it or to type the date out on each record. 

To use the bookmarklet:

    Click on the 533 field in a record
    Click on the bookmarklet on the your bookmarks toolbar

To work, it requires a 533$$n starting with the text "Description based on contents viewed" with a full-stop at the end. It produces a date in the format 18 August 2020.
